# Data - Data managment, data access priviliges, data security

## File/folder structure

- in order to process and analyse data effectively it has to be stored in a structured way
- primary data ingested by OTP and directly created by OTP is read only to prevent accidental modification

## Data access management

- data access is detemrined by data *owners*
- data ownership is a hot topic - who owns the data? Sample curator? Financer of generation of data? **Patient?** 
   - all have a claim, but the **most** important owner is the patient - their right to privacy supercedes all secondary claims
- Datanschutz is king
- in order to adhere to data protection requirement, data access is highly regulated
- all primary and derived data from a project has to remain in the managed directories (i.e. no data in your home folder or laptop!)

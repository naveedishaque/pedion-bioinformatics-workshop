# Data - Data managment, data access priviliges, data security

## Data management
- Data management is performed via the OTP platform
- OTP ingest primary data (sequencing reads) and stores it in a structured way
- OTP processes this data to a more usefull form when there is a trigger event - e.g. if tumor and control sample alignments are available, then call somatic mutations

## Data access 
- Granted and regulated via OTP

## Data security
- Managed using linux user group and control file/folder structure
- Adhering to the sctrict folder structure is **mandatory** to ensure data security

# Getting started - what is PeDiOn, what data is produced, how to I get access?

## PeDiOn
- Personalised Digital Oncology (PeDiOn) is a precision oncology program at the BIH and Charite
- It currently utilises whole genome and transcriptome sequencing on the Illumina Novaseq platform
- Aims to bridge the application of whole genome sequencing into clinical routine for cancer therapy
- PeDiOn is more than just bioinformatics - it covers all steps of the workflow from sample pathology to clinical interpretation
- The pilot phase in 2020 has 9 projects, most of which are focused on whole genome profiling
- The project currently produces whole genome sequencing, total RNA sequencing, and DNA methylation sequencing data

## Data
- sequeincing of the samples is performed by the BIH Core Unit Genomics (CUGE) headed by Tomasz Zemoitl
- data is demultiplexed from CUGE and transfered to OTP in The Center for Digital Health (from Marten Jaeger to Philipp Strubel)
- project rights management is performed via OTP, mediated via Naveed Ishaque, and handled via Philipp Stubel, Jan-Philipp Albrech and Stefan Schneider (Digital Health)

## How to get access to the data
- first and foremost you need a Charite user account
- if you are working remotely you need to apply for:
    - VPN access (VPN Antrag)
    - VPN extension B (VPN ZusatzAntrag B), signed by Roland Eils
    - Access to OTP (by registering on http://s-bih-otp-www.bihealth.org:8080/otp/)
    - Access to the eils-hpc (by speaking to Naveed Ishaque, who forwards the request to Stefan Schneider)
